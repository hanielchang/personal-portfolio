        About Me
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="bio-text">
      Welcome to my portfolio. I am part of the UCSB alumni class of 2020. I studied Physics with an emphasis
      in electronics, including some software. While my interest in the theoretical side is strong, I found
      computer to be quite intriguing. Coding first appeared strange to me, but as I realized the power of it, 
      I started to appreciate practicing it more and more. This inspired my motivation to pursue coding even after
      graduating UCSB. This led me to completing a full 6 months of coding bootcamp! I always look to improve my skillset 
      and knowledge, as well as make new connections.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="bio-text">
      Apart from working and doing coding, I also like to play video games and dance. Halo is one of my favorite video games,
      if you didn't notice my background poster! Dancing to me is very important, because it always my brain to get out of working 
      mode and drift into a more creative side. Apart from expressing mental creativity, it also keeps me in great shape. Hip hop dance
      is my most practiced type of dance. I also enjoy salsa dance.
